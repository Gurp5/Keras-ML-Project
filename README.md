# Machine Learning Project with Keras (Predicting Concrete Strength: Unveiling the Power of Neural Networks with Keras)

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project implemented with Keras. The project aims to predict the strength of concrete based on various features using a neural network model built with Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `concrete_data.csv`. It contains the following features (predictors) and the target variable:

- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age
- Strength (target variable)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repository


3. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Explore the dataset and the Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- `README.md`: This file, containing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
- `concrete_data.csv`: The dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter Notebooks with the project code.
    - `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing steps.
